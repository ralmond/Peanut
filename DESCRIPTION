Description: This provides support of learning conditional probability
    tables parameterized using CPTtools. This provides and object oriented
    layer on top of a CPTtools, to facilitate calculations with
    Parameterized models for Bayesian networks.  Peanut is a collection of
    abstract classes and generic functions defining a protocol, with the
    intent that the protocol can be implemented  with different Bayes net
    engines.  The companion pacakge PNetica provides an implementation
    using Netica and RNetica.
