\title{
Gets the title or comments associated with a Netica network.
}
\description{

The title is a longer name for a network which is not subject to naming
restrictions. The description is free form text used to document the
network.  Both fields are optional.
}
\usage{
PnetTitle(net)
PnetTitle(net) <- value
PnetDescription(net)
PnetDescription(net) <- value
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{net}{
    A \code{\link{NeticaBN}} object.
  }
  \item{value}{
    A character object giving the new title or comment.
  }
}

\details{
  The title is meant to be a human readable alternative to the name,
  which is not limited to the \code{\link{IDname}} restrictions.  The
  title also affects how the network is displayed in the Netica GUI.

  The comment is any text the user chooses to attach to the network.  If
  \code{value} has length greater than 1, the vector is collapsed into a
  long string with newlines separating the components.
}

\value{
A character vector of length 1 providing the title or comment.
}
